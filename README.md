Hello there!

My name is Ricardo Batista and I recently finished the 2020/2021 edition of .SWitCH() - Postgraduate in Software Development @ Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto.

Throughout the course we learned mainly Java with a big focus on Domain Driven Design and Onion Architecture. 

We applied Agile and Project-Based Learning methodologies during the entire course.

Languages/Technologies/Frameworks:

- Java
- SpringBoot
- Git
- React
- REST
- SQL / DBMS
- Javascript
- HTML / CSS
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Vagrant
- Gradle
- Maven

I'm looking forward to start an exciting carreer in Software Development with specific interest in Back-End.
